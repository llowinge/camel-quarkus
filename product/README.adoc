= Camel Quarkus Product

* This Maven Module should never leak to the ASF repo

== `camel-quarkus-product-source.json` and `quarkus-cxf-product-source.json`

* The format of these files is under our control and independent from `camel-quarkus-product.json` which is controlled by Quarkus.
* We want to be able to have additional info in these files, that we can use e.g. when doing partial productization or generating parts of our documentation.
* Both files have the same schema, but they are used slightly differently:
** While `camel-quarkus-product-source.json` is used for three things, namely
*** Transform the source tree of Camel Quarkus so that only supported extensions are built
*** Change the versions in Camel Quarkus BOM so that supported extensions depend on productized transitives
*** Override the Camel Quarkus extension metadata for the needs of the product (guide links, product support levels, etc.)
    - see the section about link:#overrides[Overrides] below.
** `quarkus-cxf-product-source.json` is used only for the last two items of the above.
    Note that `quarkus-cxf-product-source.json` impacts the versions in Camel Quarkus BOM but not in Quarkus CXF BOM
    (because changes are only done in the current Camel Quarkus source tree and we do not build Quarkus CXF partially
    anyway).

=== Schema

* `extensions` - a map from extension artifactIds to extension metadata.
  Only productized extensions are listed here.
  This list actually controls which modules get unlinked from the source tree by `cq-prod-maven-plugin:prod-excludes` mojo.
* `extensions.<artifactId>.allowedMixedTests` - if defined and set to a non-empty array of artifactIds,
  accept the mixed tests covering the given extension.
* `extensions.<artifactId>.[jvm|native]` - The support status: possible values: `community`, `techPreview`, `supported`
* `extensions.<artifactId>.comment` - A free form comment
* `additionalProductizedArtifacts` - an array of `[groupId:]artifactId` to include in the product build.
  If `groupId:` is omitted, then `org.apache.camel.quarkus` is taken as default.
  `[groupId:]artifactId` is supported since cq-maven-plugin 4.1.2
  Unlike `extensions.<artifactId>`, these are not extensions.
* `excludeTests` - an array of test module artifactIds.
  The associated test modules won't be linked in any group under `product/integration-tests-*` and they also be excluded in the config of `rpkgtests-maven-plugin` in `tooling/test-list/pom.xml`
* `versionTransformations` - a map from a version property (such as `kafka.version`) to a freemarker template that somehow transforms the version value.
  The input version is available through the `version` key.
  E.g. to remove the `.redhat*` suffix from a version, the freemarker template would look like the following `${version?replace('\\\\.redhat-.*$', '', 'r')}`. Note that four backslashes are there to first escape for JSON, then for Freemarker and finally for the Java regular expression.
  `versionTransformations` is honored only by both `mvn cq:sync-versions -N -e` and `mvn org.l2x6.cq:cq-prod-maven-plugin:prod-excludes -N`.
* `guideUrlTemplate` - a template for generating a URL pointing at a guide of the given extension in the CEQ product documentation.
  It allows for the following placeholders:
** `${productMajorMinorVersion}` - the major version of the Red Hat Build of Apache Camel product, e.g. `4.4` for CEQ 3.8.0
** `${artifactId}` - the artifactId of the given extension; e.g. `quarkus-cxf`
** `${artifactIdBase}` - the base of the artifactId of the given extension; e.g. if the extension artifactId is `camel-quarkus-activemq` then the `artifactIdBase` would be `activemq`.
* `additionalExtensionDependencies` - a map from `[groupdId:]artifactId` to `groupId:artifactId`. It allows multiple additional deps in a single string and separate them by comma or whitespace.
* `transitiveDependencyReplacements` - a map from `groupId:artifactId` to `groupId:artifactId`. Any artifacts matching some given key will be replaced by the corresponding value when compiling the reports in `product/src/main/generated/transitive-dependencies-*.txt`. The primary purpose of these replacement is to keep the report reproducible across operating systems, effectively replacing MacOS and Windows specific artifacts with the corresponding Linux ones.
* `ignoredTransitiveDependencies` - a list of `groupId[:artifactId[:version]]` patterns (`*` wildcard allowed). All matching artifacts and their transitive dependencies will be ignored when compiling the reports in `product/src/main/generated/transitive-dependencies-*.txt`.
* `platformOverridesSupportAttributeName` - the name of attribute under `<extension>.metadata` in platform overrides files
  (`org.apache.camel.quarkus:camel-quarkus-product::json:${version}`, `org.apache.camel.quarkus:camel-quarkus-product:cxf:json:${version}`).
  Used when transforming product files `camel-quarkus-product-source.json` and `quarkus-cxf-product-source.json` to platform overrides files.
  For CEQ versions before 3.27.0, the value `redhat-support` should be used.
  For 3.27.0+ versions, the name for the Red Hat CEQ product should be `redhat-camel-support`.

  Since cq-prod-maven-plugin 4.18.0

=== Updating the source tree after changing `camel-quarkus-product-source.json` or `quarkus-cxf-product-source.json`

Run the following from the root directory of the source tree:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn org.l2x6.cq:cq-prod-maven-plugin:prod-excludes -N
# and rebuild the tree to trigger some additional source generators
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dquarkus.build.skip
----

and commit the changes.

If `product/src/main/generated/required-productized-camel-artifacts.txt` was changed
it needs to get copied to the corresponding Camel branch - the `product/README.adoc` in Camel.

Note that the consistency of the source tree with `camel-quarkus-product-source.json` is checked by
the `cq-prod-maven-plugin:prod-excludes-check` mojo bound to `validate` phase of the build.

The `transitive-deps` mojo needs to be run after `install` because it relies on Camel Quarkus artifacts and all their transitive dependencies being available in the local Maven repo at least.

=== The modified source tree

==== Build and test the productized part

The default profile-less build `mvn clean install` will include

* All productized extensions
* A mixed BOM
* Tests that cover productized extensions and have no non-productized dependencies.
  These tests can be run via `cd product/integration-tests-product && mvn verify -Pnative`.

Note that the default profile-less build `mvn clean install` will *not* include all tests
necessary to cover the productized extensions.
This is the case because some productized extensions are covered by tests requiring non-productized artifacts.
Those tests that are really essential for covering the productized extensions are called "allowed mixed tests".
They are explicitly marked via `extensions.<artifactId>.allowedMixedTests` in `camel-quarkus-product-source.json`.
To run them you need to

[source,shell]
----
$ cd product/integration-tests-mixed-allowed && mvn clean verify -Pmixed,native
----

==== Run the rest of the mixed tests

[source,shell]
----
$ cd product/integration-tests-mixed-jvm && mvn clean test -Pmixed
$ cd product/integration-tests-mixed-native && mvn clean verify -Pmixed,native
----

[[overrides]]
== `camel-quarkus-product.json` and `quarkus-cxf-product.json`

* These files are generated by the `cq-prod-maven-plugin:platform-overrides` mojo.
* They can be found in the `target` directory of the `product` module.
* They contain a list of extensions supported (or being tech-preview) in CEQ.
* They are leveraged by Quarkus tooling in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-platform[Quarkus Platform]
